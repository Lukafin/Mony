# Mony

Visualize different UI directions by combining project briefs with designer
personas and generating concept images through the OpenRouter image API.

## Features

- Describe the UI you want to explore via a CLI argument.
- Mix and match designer prompt templates stored as markdown files.
- Generate concept images for each selected designer using OpenRouter.
- Preview prompts without generating images via `--dry-run` mode.
- Supply one or more reference images or URLs to steer the generation results.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a Python 3.10+ virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenRouter key:

   ```bash
   echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-..." > .env
   ```

## Usage

Designer prompts live inside the `designers/` directory. The CLI resolves the
provided names to markdown files (e.g. `modern` â†’ `designers/modern.md`).

Generate images for multiple designer personas:

```bash
python -m mony "Cross-platform personal finance dashboard" modern funky conservative
```

Run in dry-run mode to inspect the assembled prompts without making API calls:

```bash
python -m mony "Meditation mobile onboarding flow" modern funky --dry-run
```

Customize options such as model, image size, prompt suffix, and output directory:

```bash
python -m mony "AI writing assistant workspace" modern \
  --model openrouter/flux-schnell \
  --size 768x1024 \
  --prompt-suffix "Render as a Figma mockup"
```

Provide reference imagery from a local file or URL. The CLI inlines local files
as base64 and passes all references to the OpenRouter `image[]` parameter:

```bash
python -m mony "Smart home control hub" modern \
  --reference ./moodboard.png \
  --reference https://example.com/layout-inspiration.png
```

Generated images are saved under the `outputs/` directory with timestamps.

## Environment variables

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: required for non dry-run usage. Loaded from the current
  environment or the `.env` file specified via `--env-file`.
